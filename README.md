# Testing Algorithm Complexity

## This repository help us to calculate the running time of an algorithm

## We have 2 examples:

- Reading of a CSV file and Save to SQLite Database
- Sum of elements in a list

### For testing the app, type  following instructions in your terminal:

```
python test_csv.py
```

python test_sums.py
```
