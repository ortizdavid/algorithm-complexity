# Testing Algorithm Complexity

## This repository help us to calculate the running time of a algorithm

## We have 2 examples:

- Reading of a CSV file and Save to SQLite Database
- Sum of elements in a list

### for testing the app, type  following instructions in your terminal

### Reading of a CSV
```
python test_csv.py

```

### Reading sum of Elements
```
python test_sums.py

```
